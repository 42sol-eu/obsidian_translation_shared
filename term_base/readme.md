# Reame: Term-Base or Glossary

A term-base or glossary is on of the most important tools for a good translation.

As language is not alsways easily translated and the choices of the words and other options are important.

For example:
> Should the term "Obsidian-Community-Plugin" really be translated to be something like "Obsidian-Intressensgruppenerweiterung"? To solve and document these options and decissions the term-base is used
> 
## How does it work?

Of course I can not define that for every team and language, working myself ([[42soleu]]) on the [[translations/de/readme\|German translation]] let us use this as a show case.

TODO: insert here

The termbase will be one or more notes with mainly a table ((is this exportable to csv?))
The first columns will be the reference word and ID for the term
The following collumns will hold three choices to be used followed by a column with translations that should not be used. Seperated by a note column with links to further dicussion - sometimes in the native language.
