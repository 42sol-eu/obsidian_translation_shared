# Readme: Obsidian Translation Shared

> Shared translation resources for Obsidian.

> **Imortant:** This is not the official resource but a community driven vault!

> **Obviously:** Using this vault be kind and stay in an open and forgiving mindset!

> **Imortant:** This vault might become a "German only" vault, if during 2022 no other translators get value of it.

## Aim

- Obsidian is a great extensiable application to create your Personal Knowlage Management (PKM).
- It is developed with support and help of the community - **especially** for translation 
- Though many of the active users will be tend to use the English version, it is great to have a native UI and **a good native help**

> At the moment (end of 2021) the translation seem to be handled in a mix between the two Github repositories, the forum, Github-pull-requests-comments and assumably many privat messages.
> **I was wondering if this could not be improved using a shared Obsidian Vault**
> Let's try that!

- I also found editing in complex JSON-files not very easy so I used some scripts to improve the translators experiance [[Y_gears/Readme]]
