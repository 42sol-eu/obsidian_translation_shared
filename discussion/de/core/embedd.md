# Embedd 
see also [[add]]

From:
- Einbettung 
	- (Context: add embedd)

To: (suggestion from #42soleu)
- ??? (no good direct translation)
	- (Notiz einbetten)

#42soleu:
> Does this word even exist in German?
> [Duden](https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Einbettung) says yes.
> But it is not really fitting to this context. 
> The verb is much more commonly used - I think.
